# Calorie widget

The Apple Health app only shows you your active and resting calories for the day as individual metrics. The aim of this widget is to display the total combined calories burned today as a single number on the home screen.

Home screen widgets will be released with iOS 14, and this seems to be a good project to learn Swift.
